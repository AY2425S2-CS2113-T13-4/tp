## Component Details

### 1. Main component
`RollaDie` class is the starting point of the program. It will call the mainMenu() method which displays a list of choices to the player, namely, starting a new game, loading from a previous save, and to exit from the game completely.

The main menu is also displayed when the player is defeated and ends a game. This allows for convenient game continuation.

The bulk of the app’s work is done by the following components:
- `Functions`: Encapsulates all printing methods and terminal animations.
- `Game`: Gameplay mechanics and loop logic.
- `Storage`: Manages saving and loading data to and from the hard disk.
- `Exception`: Handle Exceptions during runtime.

### 2. Functions component     

The `UI` class manages all the console prints including the ASCII characters and model representations. When an animation is required, it directs the call to the respective packages that hold the methods, such as `DiceBattleAnimation`, `TypewriterEffect` and `HpBar`, to invoke the correct animation sequence to play for the player.

It also encompasses the methods to read inputs from the player.

The following are all the essential methods used for UI display within the game.

#### BattleDisplay pkg
`showPlayerStatus(Player)` - draw Player stats at the start of each round.
#### HpBar
`animate(Player1, Player2, prevHP1, prevHP2, diceDisplay)` - animate the HP bar to show the changes in HP visually, with colours representing the HP status.
#### DiceBattleAnimation pkg
`animateBattle(int[] player1rolls, int[]player2rolls` - draw dice rolling animation for both players, side-by-side. Vary the number of dice by passing different sized integer arrays into the method.
#### TypewriterEffect pkg
`print(text)` or `print(text, withDelayAfterwards)` - prints the text character by character, with a longer pause at commas and full stops.
#### TerminalClear pkg
`clearAndWrite(contentToWriteAfterClearingScreen)` - simplifies the clear screen method and reduces stuttering or flickering observed on Windows terminals.
#### Narrator
`commentOnHealth(Player)` - Narrate the amount of Hit Points a certain player has remaining.
`commentOnMomentum(Player1, Player2, damageDealt, p2PrevHp)` - Spot the dynamics changing within the battle and announce to boost or quash Player morale.

### 3. Game component       
The game component stores the main game logic. The game runs in two loops, one external loop managing the waves of enemy encounters, and another responsible for the battle sequence.

The waves indicate the number of enemies the player has faced from the beginning of the game. Rounds show the number of bouts that the player has made against the current enemy.

When the player faces against an enemy, the `StartBattle()` method is called. This puts the game inside a loop until either character falls. The outcome of the battle determines if the player proceeds to the next encounter.

`StartBattle(Player1, Player2)` - begin battle sequence for a wave

### 4. Storage component

The Storage Component is responsible for saving and loading Game progress.

It reads and writes Game data to a text file (savefile.txt), ensuring that players can resume their Game after closing the application.         

The Storage class provides the following functionalities:

1. Save the Game:

- The `saveGame(Player, Event, Queue<Event>)` method writes player stats, the current event,
and upcoming events to a file.
- It converts Game objects into a text format using their `toText()` methods.

2. Load the Game:

- The `loadGame()` method reads the save file and reconstructs the Game state.
- It calls helper methods `parseCharacterFromText()` and `parseEventFromText()` to convert text data back into objects.
- If the save file is missing or corrupted, it creates a new Game instance instead.

3. Data Parsing:

- `parseCharacterFromText()` deciphers character stats (health, attack, defense, etc.) from text.
- `parseEventFromText()` reconstructs different Game events, such as battles, from saved data.


### 5. Exception component
- Exceptions: The program throws `RolladieException` when encountering errors, and prints a custom message to the terminal with more details.

## Implementation
## Key Features

### 1. Save and Load
**Overview**    
The Save and Load feature in Rolladie is an important part of the game as it allows players to not lose
their progress in the game. When the player starts the game, he/she is brought to the main menu, which allows them to select between Start Game, Load Game and Exit.

If a player chooses to start the game, they automatically start a new game. If the player chooses to load game, they will be able to choose a save slot to load from.

**Implementation Details**     
The Save and Load feature in RollaDie handles the storage of all player information and battle information.
1. The process begins with the player booting up the game.
2. The player will be greeted by the main menu, allowing the player to choose from 1-3, where 1 is
Start Game, 2 is Load Game and 3 is exit game.
3. If player chooses 1, a new Game object is created where player starts a new game.
4. If player chooses 2, `loadGame()` in the Storage class will be called to fetch the serialised data, which
is processed to load the game information, and initialise a new Game object based on the data fetched.
5. If player chooses 3, the game exits itself.
6. After every loot and shop event, the game also presents the users with an opportunity to save the game.
7. If the player selects "y", the game prompts the user to choose from 1-3 to save to a save slot, else 
if player selects "n", game does not save.

**Sequence Diagram**         
     
The sequence diagram below illustrates the process that occurs when the game boots and prompts user to load.

![Sequence Diagram](uml_image/saveLoadSequenceDiagram.png)

### 2. Attack       
**Overview**    
        
The Attack Feature in RollaDie is a core component of the Game's battle system, allowing the player and enemy to take turns attacking each other. The feature manages input handling, attack calculations, and battle progression.
- During the player's turn, the Game reads the player's command, determines the action, cooldown, power, and roll dice to calculate attack bonuses. 
If the player chooses to attack, the attack is executed, and damage is applied to the enemy. The Game then prints the attack message and checks if the battle has ended.      
- The player can choose from the numbers provided on screen to choose different attacks during his turn.
- During the enemy's turn, the enemy follows a similar process which is attacking the player, applying damage, and displaying attack messages. The Game continues alternating between player and enemy turns until either the player or the enemy is defeated. This feature ensures smooth battle flow, handles attack mechanics, and updates battle status dynamically, keeping the combat engaging and strategic.


**Implementation Details**     
        
The Attack Feature in RollaDie handles the player's and enemy's turn-based combat interactions. 
1. The process begins with the player's turn, where the user enters a command, which is read and parsed by the player class.  
2. The parsed command is processed by Player, which sets chosen ability based on the command parsed.       
3. If the player's attack requires power, deduct the required power. If power is insufficient, return invalid attack.
4. The player’s attack chosen will start its cooldown is sent to the **Battle** class where the attack will be stored as the player's ability chosen. The enemy will then choose ability based on `chooseAIAction()` method in Player class.
5. Both player and enemy will then roll dices to determine the damage that they do based on the formula: damage =
`[(dice roll result) + (num of dice) * (weapon bonus) - (opponent armor defense)] * [(power) / (max power) * 0.5 * (ability damage multiplier)]`
5. Both the player and enemy will then carry out their move and attack each other, deducting both characters' health based on damage formula.
6. Cooldown of all abilities decreases by 1.
7. This loop repeats until the battle ends.

**Sequence Diagram**         
     
The sequence diagram below illustrates the process that occurs when the player inputs an attack command.

![Sequence Diagram](uml_image/attackSequence.png)

### 3. Heal        
**Overview**

The heal Feature in RollaDie allows players to adopt a heal during their turn instead of attacking.
This feature enhances strategic gameplay by giving the player an option to heal and recover both
health and power which is needed for casting skills.The battle sequence continues until either 
the player or the enemy is defeated.

**Implementation Details**   
The implementation is generally very similar to the attack feature above, with the only difference being the action used.

During the player’s turn:
1. The user inputs command "2", which is the heal action.
2. The parsed command is processed by Player, which sets chosen heal ability based on the command parsed.      
3. The heal action will start its cooldown and is sent to the **Battle** class where the heal action
is stored as the player's ability chosen. The enemy will also choose an ability.
4. Only the enemy rolls a die and the player will be healed for a flat amount of health. The enemy will deal damage
based on die roll while the player will heal a fixed amount.

**Sequence Diagram**        

The sequence diagram is shared with the attack feature above.



### 4. Flee        
**Overview**      
The flee feature in Rolladie is to allow the player to escape from nasty situations.
This feature allows players to make a strategic retreat to re gear up before fighting strong enemies.
When the player chooses to flee, the battle ends immediately and the player goes onto the next event.

**Implementation Details**          
1. During the player's turn, **PlayerTurn** class gets the current action of player.
2. If player chooses to flee, **PlayerTurn** sets hasSurrendered in **Turn** to true.
3. **BattleLogic** checks if hasSurrendered in **Turn** is true and sets hasWon to false and hasBattleEnded to true.
4. **BattleLogic** returns hasWon = false to **Battle** class to end the battle.

**Sequence Diagram**          
![Sequence Diagram](uml_image/fleeSequence.png)



### 5. Loot      
**Overview**
The loot feature in Rolladie allows the player to get gold after winning a battle.
This feature enables players to earn gold to upgrade himself in the shop.
If player does not win battle, he does not get gold.

**Implementation Details**
1. After the battle, **Battle** object will send hasWon to **Game** to set the hasWonCurrBattle in Game to true
or false depending on whether the player won or fled from the battle.
2. **Game** sets the hasWon variable in **Loot** based on hasWonCurrBattle.
3. If hasWon in **loot** is true, add gold to player and print the loot that the player got.
4. If hasWon in **loot** is false, print that the player got no loot.
